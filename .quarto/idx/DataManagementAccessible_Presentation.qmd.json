It is, therefore, important to maintain, organize and share our data in a way that will be useful and meaningful to current-us and future-us.\n\nBut, data storage is costly, in terms of space for storing data, space for backing up data, and time for managing, organizing and documenting data, and so on...\n\n*We want to be mindful in our data management strategies and application*.\n\n**At least 50% of data management is people-related.**\n\n## Ideally... {.smaller}\n\nA well-designed data management system will:\n\n-   Make archiving, storing, and retrieving information less difficult and tedious;\n\n-   Ensure the integrity and continuity of record keeping, *despite changes in personnel*;\n\n-   Allow for the easy identification and purging of outdated information;\n\n-   Allow us to more easily share our information...with managers, collaborators, the public;\n\n-   Be foundational;\n\n    -   The technologies we use are ever-changing. Think about the different waves of emerging technologies: GIS, genetics, stable isotopes, machine learning.\n\n    -   We can't predict what will come next, but if we manage our data well, it will be easier to adapt.\n\n-   Be uniform in implementation; and\n\n-   Be expandable and flexible to meet future needs.\n\n## Staff Engagement  {.smaller}\n\nHow do we come together as a team to engage in data management most effectively? \n\n-   Recognizing and appreciating **our different skills, technical abilities, ideas, backgrounds, and ways of learning** (among many other things)\n\n-   Ensuring data practices **promote fair, just and beneficial outcomes for all individuals and projects**\n\n-   Ensuring that data collection, storage, and analysis **processes actively consider** our perspectives, experiences, and skills (in our case, largely focused on ensuring this for how we collect and store data, trainings on those processes, etc.)\n\n-   The data and the information about the **data are accessible** to staff to use\n\n-   **Staff feel accepted and supported** in projects and within program\n\n## Data Management Life Cycle\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, height = 5, fig.cap=\"Adopted from DataOne.\"}\nlibrary(DiagrammeR)\n\ngrViz(\"digraph flowchart {\n      # node definitions with substituted label text\n      node [fontname = Arial, shape = rectangle, penwidth = 3]        \n      tab1 [label = '@@1', color = MediumVioletRed]\n      tab2 [label = '@@2', color = Tomato]\n      tab3 [label = '@@3', color = Gold]\n      tab4 [label = '@@4', color = YellowGreen]\n      tab5 [label = '@@5', color = DarkOliveGreen]\n      tab6 [label = '@@6', color = CadetBlue]\n      tab7 [label = '@@7', color = Navy]\n\n      # edge definitions with the node IDs\n      tab1 -> tab2;\n      tab2 -> tab3;\n      tab3 -> tab4;\n      tab4 -> tab5;\n      tab5 -> tab6;\n      tab6 -> tab7;\n      tab7 -> tab1;\n      }\n\n      [1]: 'Plan (as best and as much as you can)'\n      [2]: 'Obtain/Collect (the fun part, most of the time)'\n      [3]: 'Process/Assure (quality assurance and control)'\n      [4]: 'Describe (data documentation)'\n      [5]: 'Preserve (at data center or archive)'\n      [6]: 'Discover (make your data findable)'\n      [7]: 'Integrate/Analyze (you know this part better than me)'\n      \")\n```\n\n## Data Management Life Cycle\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, height = 5, fig.cap=\"Updated to reflect common practices.\"}\ngrViz(\"digraph flowchart {\n      # node definitions with substituted label text\n      node [fontname = Arial, shape = rectangle, penwidth = 3]        \n      tab1 [label = '@@1', color = MediumVioletRed]\n      tab2 [label = '@@2', color = Tomato]\n      tab3 [label = '@@3', color = Gold]\n      tab4 [label = '@@4', color = YellowGreen]\n      tab5 [label = '@@5', color = DarkOliveGreen]\n      tab6 [label = '@@6', color = CadetBlue]\n      tab7 [label = '@@7', color = Navy]\n\n      # edge definitions with the node IDs\n      tab1 -> tab2;\n      tab2 -> tab3;\n      tab2 -> tab7 [color = Orange, penwidth = 4];\n      tab3 -> tab4;\n      tab3 -> tab1;\n      tab3 -> tab7;\n      tab4 -> tab5;\n      tab5 -> tab6;\n      tab6 -> tab7;\n      tab7 -> tab1;\n      tab7 -> tab4;\n      tab7 -> tab2  [color = Red, penwidth = 4];\n      tab2 -> tab7  [color = Red, penwidth = 4];\n      }\n\n      [1]: 'Plan (as best and as much as you can)'\n      [2]: 'Obtain/Collect (the fun part, most of the time)'\n      [3]: 'Process/Assure (quality assurance and control)'\n      [4]: 'Describe (data documentation)'\n      [5]: 'Preserve (at data center or archive)'\n      [6]: 'Discover (make your data findable)'\n      [7]: 'Integrate/Analyze (you know this part better than me)'\n      \")\n```\n\n## Data Management is Inclusive\n\n![](images/pep_workflow.png)\n\n## Workflow Potential Bottlenecks\n\n![](images/pep_bottleneecks.png)\n\n## Plan {.smaller}\n\n-   Start your project and research off with good planning and design.\n\n-   Data management is just *one* part of this early planning (and the only focus of this presentation).\n\n-   Early planning takes a lot of work, but working through all these steps from the beginning will save you *so much* time later.\n\n![](images/planning.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Plan: Things to Consider {.smaller}\n\n-   What data will be generated? What data need to be gathered from other places (within your program, within MML, from outside sources)?\n\n-   Where will data for the project be stored (on the network, in a database, on Google Drive, etc.)?\n\n    -   How will the data be organized? What does the folder structure look like? How will files be named?\n\n    -   What does the database structure look like? How will data be entered or imported?\n\n-   How will information about the data be preserved? (GitHub, meeting notes, important decisions, etc.)\n\n-   How will the data move through all the subsequent steps (collection, assurance, description, preservation, discovery, integration and analysis)?\n\n-   Who is responsible for doing what? (an important one!)\n\n## Plan: Folder Organization Ideas {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column .smaller width=\"70%\"}\n-   Consider how to organize folders (by date, project, species).\n\n    -   Create folders with a top-down hierarchy.\n\n    -   Organize images separately.\n\n    -   Don't store final data only on your laptop!\n\n-   If you're going to do a big reorganization, consider deleting and archiving things first.\n\n-   For program-wide efforts, work together as a team to come up with different ways to store data, test out some mock-ups, and settle on a solution that works best for the group.\n\n-   Establish a system for version control (e.g. file-naming, Git). Not everything needs version control. Delete obsolete versions of files.\n\n-   Maintain whatever system you come up with -- check in, adjust it, and clean it up annually.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/old_files.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Plan: Folder Organization: Personal {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n**Personal File Management** (could be on computer or in user's folder)\n\n![](images/sample_folder_structure_personal.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n## Plan: Folder Organization: Program {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n**Main Folder Structure**\n\n![](images/sample_folder_network_1.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n**Subfolders within...Data**\n\n![](images/sample_folder_network_2.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n**...ProgramMgmt & Projects**\n\n![](images/sample_folder_network_3.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Plan: Google Drive Organization...oof {.smaller}\n\nThere are two camps here (and I've highlighted some considerations for each):\n\n-   Let your files be (exist wherever they exist) and share as-needed.\n\n    -   Requires little to no folder organization overhead.\n\n    -   Relies on the search functionality within Google Drive to find things.\n\n-   Organize your files like you would a folder structure on the network or on your computer.\n\n    -   Simpler for on-boarding new staff (who may not know what to search for).\n\n    -   Can provide a more clear framework for groups working together.\n\n    -   More overhead required for managing files.\n\n    -   New Google Shared Drives are an option for shared spaces without \"ownership\" by a single individual.\n\nFor larger groups (at the program- or project-scale), I'd recommend organizing a centralized folder system and sharing within that, but either way, it's a good conversation to have.\n\n## Plan: Google Drive Organization {.smaller}\n\n**PEP Centralized Google Drive Folder Structure**\n\n![](images/pepGoogleDrive.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n**LAN vs Google Drive**\n\n-   I can't tell you what is best for you or your project or your program.\n\n-   This should be a group discussion and decision.\n\n-   Document this for yourself and future users (read_me file, project manual, etc.)\n\n## Plan: File Naming {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"33%\"}\n![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/documents.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column .smaller width=\"67%\"}\nFile names ideally describe the project, file contents, location, and date -- and should be unique enough to stand alone as file descriptions.\n\n**File names should be**:\n\n-   Human-readable\n\n-   Machine-readable\n\n-   Plays well with default ordering (!)\n\n    -   This may mean different solutions for different projects/reasons.\n    -   Order by date, number, name, etc.\n    -   Most general to most specific.\n\n-   Same rules apply to folder names!\n:::\n:::\n\n## Plan: File Naming Conventions {.smaller}\n\n-   File names should be unique, simple, SHORT, and readable.\n\n-   Avoid using spaces. Alternative ways to break up file naming without spaces: CamelCase, lowerCamelCase, snake_case, CamelCase_PlusSnakeCase.\n\n-   Use only alpha-numeric characters.

Preserve it, imperfections and all.\n\n    -   Use a separate process to clean the data, ideally scripted to make the process reproducible (more to come on this in the Assure section).\n\n    -   Work off the cleaned version of the data.\n\n-   Import raw or manually enter data into a database!\n\n## Obtain/Collect: Standardization\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n<div>\n\n**Main Folder Structure**\n\n![](images/coastal_data_1.png)\n\n</div>\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n<div>\n\n**Subfolder Structure**\n\n![](images/coastal_data_2.png)\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n## Obtain/Collect: Wide vs Long Formats\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Wide Format**\n\n![](images/sample_results_wide.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Long Format** (preferred)\n\n![](images/sample_results_long.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Obtain/Collect: Measurements + Units {.smaller}\n\n-   If you're storing the data in a wide format (each measurement type gets it's own field)...\n\n    -   AND all the measurements are in the same unit, store the unit at the end of the field name (e.g. length_m).\n\n    -   AND the measurements are collected in different units, you could easily get yourself in trouble. Either (preferably) convert to all the same units and name the field accordingly (with units at the end) OR create another field in which you store the associated units.\n\n-   If you're storing the data in a long format (all measurements in the same field, with another field indicating the measurement type), either create a measurement unit field OR (in a database) related the measurements to a measurement type lookup table and store the unit information there.\n\n## Obtain/Collect: Archive/Storage {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n-   Store data in non-proprietary formats (when possible) that are easy to work with in programming software:\n\n    -   CSV\n\n    -   Text files\n\n    -   Database - benefit of related data and lookup values\n\n        -   PostgreSQL / SQL Server / Azure / Oracle\n\n        -   Geodatabases\n\n-   Avoid long field names.\n\n-   Avoid using special characters and spaces in field names.\n\n-   Store spatial data in appropriate projections.

Is it accessible?\n\n-   Do we have processes in place to reduce process errors, and especially individual responsibility?\n\n-   Does the process for retrieving and updating data clear and avoidant of errors?\n\n-   Is the process for sharing data for an analysis inclusive of a diversity of perspectives?

Find and use the best technology for the task at hand.\n\n-   Don't compare yourself to other people.\n\n-   Don't be afraid to try new things or fail the first (or first few times) you try something new.\n\n    -   My data-related nemesis is date/time time zones. I *still* get them wrong more than I'd like to admit and have to check myself. Every. Single. Time.\n\n-   Celebrate your successes!\n\n-   Ask others for help, if you're stuck or want a different perspective.\n\n## Next Steps {.smaller}\n\n-   This information can be applied to your individual work or to projects.\n\n    -   For individual files and information, learn from one another!\n    -   For projects, this should be a team effort.\n        -   No one person can do all the things.\n\n        -   Be clear and intentional.\n\n        -   None of the examples presented in these slides were done by me in isolation!\n\n-   This presentation may have been a little or a lot of new information for you.\n\n    -   If it was not a lot of new information for you, you're off to a great start! Share your knowledge with your colleagues and help them get more comfortable.\n    -   If it was a lot of new information for you (and maybe you're feeling overwhelmed with where to start), pick one thing from one section and give it a try.\n\n-   I am *always* happy to talk about data things. Feel free to ask questions, run things by me, etc.\n\n## Resources {.smaller}\n\n-   [NOAA Data Management
